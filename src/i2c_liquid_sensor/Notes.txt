sump pump water Level conditions

pin 5 - High level    # Highest water level when 1 turn on pump
pin 6 - Low level     # lowest water level when 0 turn off pump

Pin 7 - PRI sensors 
when PRI pin high motion is sensed, wait once it goes low, 
wait at least 300 Seconds before turning off light. this is all done at the onion Omega side using MQTT


possible states

Pump on         1  # both sensors high we need to empty the container
High level      1
Low Level       1

"pump off" water rising or "pump on" water is being emptied.
pump on         1    Pump is empting container  
pump off        0    pump is waiting for High level to become 1 to start empting container
High level      0    (for a short period this would have been a 1 until we emptied some of the water.)
Low Level       1

pump off        0     once both sensors 0 then we can turn off pump
High level      0
Low Level       0     (for a short time this would have been a 1 until we empty some more water)

not possible based on position of sensors Low level will always be 1 if High level becomes 1.
High level      1
Low Level       0
