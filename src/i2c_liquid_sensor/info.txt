    Using I2C in a Sketch Right now the Onion Library joins the I2C bus with an address of 
    0x08 and listens for a write of 0xde 0xad (get it? 'dead' ha ha ha) when resetting. If 
    you need a Sketch to use I2C, make sure to build this functionality into your I2C 
    handling to comply with the Arduino Dock flashing procedure.
This has a few implications: Since the Arduino can only join the I2C bus as a master (using 
    Wire.begin()) or a slave (using Wire.begin(<i2c-addr>)) the above statement REQUIRES the 
    Arduino to join the I2C bus as a slave using Wire.begin(0x08) Since it is required from 
    the above that the Arduino lists for a write from the Omega of 0xde 0xad it is necessary 
    to know what action the Arduino should take when it receives this message. From gleaning 
    the code in 
    https://github.com/OnionIoT/Onion-Arduino-Library/blob/master/Onion/OnionLibrary.cpp it 
    is found that the code to be executed on the Arduino on receipt of this message is: 
    wdt_enable(WDTO_15MS); It would be extremely helpful if this was described in the 
    documentation. Because the Arduino HAS TO BE an I2C slave on address 0x08 as above, it 
    is not possible for it to be an I2C master and control other I2C devices. This is not 
    necessarily a big deal since the Omega can still use I2C to access any Arduino I2C 
    shields that may be plugged into the Arduino Dock But again, it would be helpful if this 
    was clear in the documentation Note that sending the 0xde 0xad message from the Omega to 
    the Arduino can be performed by the following call to the code in 
    https://github.com/OnionIoT/i2c-exp-driver/blob/master/src/lib/onion-i2c.c in the 
    https://github.com/OnionIoT/i2c-exp-driver library:
    i2c_write(0, 0x08, 0xde, 0xad);
